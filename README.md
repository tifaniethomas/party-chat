<h1>Party Chat</h1>

As a student in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, our second project is a MEN-stack CRUD app. I chose to make a retro-themed chat room with user-profiles. 

I used a combination of MongoDB with Mongoose-defined Schemas, Express, and Node.js to create the chat and profile functionality, with user login credentials handled through OAuth and Passport. 

This was very challenging. I found it to be a real mental workout to break apart all the entity relationships and how they work together, which data types need to be embedded and which need to be relational, calculate all the proper RESTful routes and give each page the appropriate design to be nice-looking and still funcitonal.

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
Thank you so much to Michael and Victor for being available to answer all the questions I had along the way. Also, huge thanks to my group of classmates who were there to help me in the in-between giving me great tips and help with anything I may need.

<h3>Plans for the future</h3>
I would love to add webhook functionality to allow the page to refresh when data changes on its own. I also have plans to add emoji avatar selection to the profile page to populate an image for the chat.
